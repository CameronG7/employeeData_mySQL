## Description

![alt text](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue )

In this project I have developed the code for a command line app that allows the user with interact with an employee database.
This was accomplished by using sql queries using that are ran based on their answers to prompts. 
This project was a good way to further develop my skills in the backend on my way to becoming a fullstack developer. 
The app also serves the functional purpose of being something very similar to the sklls I would need to help my current job develop a parts database.
